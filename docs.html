  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>
    To install Meteorite via npm run <code>npm install -g meteorite</code>
  </p>

  <h2>Adding packages</h2>
  
  <h3>From the command line</h3>
  <p>
    The easiest way to install a smart package is to use Meteorite's <code>add</code> command
  </p>

<pre>
mrt add moment
</pre>

  <p>
    Or if you want a specific version
  </p>

<pre>
mrt add moment --version 1.6.2
</pre>

  <p class="alert">
    Currently, unlike Meteor's <code>add</code> subcommand, you can only specify one package at a time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Behind the scenes Meteorite will add package metadata to a file called <code>smart.json</code> in your app's root directory. This file can be manually edited and Meteorite will install/uninstall/upgrade packages as the specification changes.
  </p>

  <h3>Manually</h3>
  
  <p>
    As mentioned above <code>smart.json</code> can be maintained manually. For more info <a href="https://github.com/oortcloud/atmosphere/blob/master/smart.json">see Atmosphere's <code>smart.json</code></a> and <a href="http://oortcloud.github.com/meteorite">Meteorite's detailed documentation</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Running the app</h2>

  <p>
    With the smart package installed and <code>smart.json</code> in place you can now run your app using Meteorite to start using the newly installed package
  </p>

<pre>
mrt -p 3333
</pre>

  <h2>Guidelines</h2>

  <p>First off a couple soft rules, give us a shout if you have any questions on this...</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Publish packages that you use in your apps. We want packages that are well loved by their creators/curators. If you don't depend on it don't publish it.</li>
    <li>Don't use the word `meteor` in your package name. Your repo might be called `meteor-cool-pkg` but you should register it as `cool-pkg`. All packages are for Meteor so including it in the name is redundant.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Preparing <code>smart.json</code></h2>

  <p>
    Atmosphere's smart packages are <em>vanilla</em> smart packages that conform to Meteor's current (private) smart package API. If you can put it in Meteor's <code>packages/</code> dir and it works it will also work with Meteorite and Atmosphere by default. If your package has no dependencies of it's own and lives in a git repo people it's already installable Meteorite. 
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two reasons you might want to add a <code>smart.json</code> to your smart package:
    <ol>
      <li>It has dependencies you want to tell Meteorite about so end users of your smart package won't have to worry about installing them</li>
      <li>You want to share your package via Atmosphere</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h3><code>smart.json</code> example</h3>
  
<pre>
{
  "name": "cool-pkg",
  "description": "Super cool package with dependencies",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/possibilities/meteor-cool-pkg",
  "author": "Mike Bannister <notimpossiblemike@gmail.com> (http://po.ssibiliti.es)",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "git": "https://github.com/possibilities/meteor-cool-pkg.git",
  "packages": {
    "another-cool-pkg": "0.1.1"
  }
}
</pre>

  <h2>Publishing</h2>

  <p>Once you have a <code>smart.json</code> in place and you've pushed the code to it's origin (yes, everything is git based right now) you can use Meteorite to publish the repository to Atmosphere (or any compatible server).</p>

  <p class="alert">
    At this point you'll need an account on Atmosphere to continue. If you don't have one click on "Sign in" in the upper right hand corner to get started!
  </p>

  <h3><code>mrt release &lt;path&gt;</code></h3>

  <p>
    Meteorite's <code>release</code> subcommand will verify the repo is committed, push, add a tag for the current version, push the tag and publish the package to Atmosphere.
  </p>

  <h3><code>mrt publish &lt;path&gt;</code></h3>

  <p>
    If you need more control over the release process you can use Meteorite's <code>publish</code> subcommand to publish the package to Atmosphere after you've tagged and pushed the repo.
  </p>

  <h2>Curating 3rd party packages</h2>
  <p>
    <em>TODO This section needs lots of love but for now <a href="https://gist.github.com/3327056">check out this gist</a> to see how I re-packaged <a href="https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string">underscore-string</a> as a smart package.</em>
