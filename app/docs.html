  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>
    To install and use Meteorite, you'll need <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">node/npm</a> and <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">git</a>. To install, run <code>npm install -g meteorite</code><br/>
    <i>Some installations may require administrator rights, if so use <code>sudo</code> eg.: <code>sudo -H npm install -g meteorite</code> (requires password)</i>
  </p>


  <h2>Adding packages</h2>
  
  <h3>From the command line</h3>
  <p>
    The easiest way to install a smart package is to use Meteorite's <code>add</code> command
  </p>

<pre>
mrt add moment
</pre>

  <p>
    Or if you want a specific version
  </p>

<pre>
mrt add moment --version 1.6.2
</pre>

  <p class="alert">
    Currently, unlike Meteor's <code>add</code> subcommand, you can only specify one package at a time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Behind the scenes Meteorite will add package metadata to a file called <code>smart.json</code> in your app's root directory. This file can be manually edited and Meteorite will install/uninstall/upgrade packages as the specification changes.
  </p>

  <h3>Manually</h3>
  
  <p>
    As mentioned above <code>smart.json</code> can be maintained manually. For more info <a href="https://github.com/oortcloud/atmosphere/blob/master/app/smart.json">see Atmosphere's <code>smart.json</code></a> and <a href="http://oortcloud.github.com/meteorite">Meteorite's detailed documentation</a>.
  </p>
  

  <h2>Running the app</h2>

  <p>
    With the smart package installed and <code>smart.json</code> in place you can now run your app using Meteorite to start using the newly installed package.
  </p>

<pre>
mrt -p 3333
</pre>

  <h2>Guidelines</h2>

  <p>First off a couple soft rules, give us a shout if you have any questions on this...</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Publish packages that you use in your apps. We want packages that are well loved by their creators/curators. If you don't depend on it don't publish it.</li>
    <li>Don't use the word `meteor` in your package name. Your repo might be called `meteor-cool-pkg` but you should register it as `cool-pkg`. All packages are for Meteor so including it in the name is redundant.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Preparing <code>smart.json</code></h2>

  <p>
    Atmosphere's smart packages are <em>vanilla</em> smart packages that conform to Meteor's current (private) smart package API. If you can put it in Meteor's <code>packages/</code> dir and it works, it will also work with Meteorite and Atmosphere by default. If your package has no dependencies of its own and lives in a git repo, it's already installable with Meteorite.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two reasons you might want to add a <code>smart.json</code> to your smart package:
    <ol>
      <li>It has dependencies you want to tell Meteorite about so end users of your smart package won't have to worry about installing them</li>
      <li>You want to share your package via Atmosphere</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h3><code>smart.json</code> example</h3>
  
<pre>
{
  "name": "cool-pkg",
  "description": "Super cool package with dependencies",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/possibilities/meteor-cool-pkg",
  "author": "Mike Bannister <notimpossiblemike@gmail.com> (http://po.ssibiliti.es)",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "git": "https://github.com/possibilities/meteor-cool-pkg.git",
  "packages": {
    "another-cool-pkg": "0.1.1"
  }
}
</pre>

  <p>
    Note: don't include in the <code>packages</code> declaration meteor packages that aren't on Atmosphere, such as jquery. Only include Atmospere packages there. In other words, <code>smart.json</code> is for Atmosphere, <code>package.js</code> is for meteor, and it's in <code>package.js</code> where you can have an <code>api.use('jquery', 'client');</code> statement if necessary.
  </p>  


  <h2>Testing your package</h2>
  <p>
    Make sure to test your package works, before publishing it. To do that, create an app that uses your package, and in that app's root directory, have a <code>smart.json</code> that points to the local path of your package:
  </p>

<pre>
{
  "meteor": {
    "branch": "master"
  },
  "packages": {
    "my-new-package" : {
      "path": "/home/meteordev/meteor-my-new-package"
    }
  }
}  
</pre>

  <p>
    Make sure the app also includes your package in <code>.meteor/packages</code>. Now run the app with <code>mrt</code>. If everything goes well, you're ready to write the <code>README.md</code> file and publish.
  </p>
  

  <h2>Publishing</h2>

  <p>Once you have a <code>smart.json</code> in place and you've pushed the code to its origin (yes, everything is git-based right now), you can use Meteorite to publish the repository to Atmosphere (or any compatible server).</p>

  <p class="alert">
    At this point you'll need an account on Atmosphere to continue. If you don't have one click on "Sign in" in the upper right hand corner to get started!
  </p>

  <h3><code>mrt release &lt;path&gt;</code></h3>

  <p>
    Meteorite's <code>release</code> subcommand will verify the repo is committed, push, add a tag for the current version, push the tag and publish the package to Atmosphere.
  </p>

  <h3><code>mrt publish &lt;path&gt;</code></h3>

  <p>
    If you need more control over the release process you can use Meteorite's <code>publish</code> subcommand to publish the package to Atmosphere after you've tagged and pushed the repo.
  </p>

  <h2>Example packages</h2>
  
  <p>
    An excellent example of a package that does everything by the book, and includes CSS, images and JavaScript, is <a href="https://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/jquery-rateit">jquery-rateit</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Adding <a href='https://travis-ci.org' target='_blank'>Travis-CI</a> support</h2>

  <p>
    It is really important have tests in your packages. You can do it easily with <a href='http://www.eventedmind.com/posts/meteor-testing-packages-with-tinytest' target='_blank'>tinytest</a>. With travis-ci you can build these tests on the cloud and put a small notitfication image on your packages as shown below.
  </p>

  <p>
  <img src="https://travis-ci.org/arunoda/meteor-cluster.png?branch=master"><br>
  </p>

  <p>
    just add following file as <code>.travis.yml</code> to your project and you are done.
  </p>

<pre>
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "0.10"
before_install:
  - "curl -L http://git.io/ejPSng | /bin/sh" 
</pre>

  <p>
    <em>TODO This section needs lots of love but for now <a href="https://gist.github.com/3327056">check out this gist</a> to see how I re-packaged <a href="https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string">underscore-string</a> as a smart package.</em>
