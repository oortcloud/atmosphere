  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>
    To install and use Meteorite, you'll need <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">node/npm</a> and <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">git</a>. To install, run <code>npm install -g meteorite</code><br/>
    <i>Some installations may require administrator rights, if so use <code>sudo</code> eg.: <code>sudo -H npm install -g meteorite</code> (requires password)</i>
  </p>


  <h2>Adding packages</h2>
  
  <h3>From the command line</h3>
  <p>
    The easiest way to install a smart package is to use Meteorite's <code>add</code> command
  </p>

<pre>
mrt add moment
</pre>

  <p>
    Or if you want a specific version
  </p>

<pre>
mrt add moment --version 1.6.2
</pre>

  <p class="alert">
    Currently, unlike Meteor's <code>add</code> subcommand, you can only specify one package at a time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Behind the scenes Meteorite will add package metadata to a file called <code>smart.json</code> in your app's root directory. This file can be manually edited and Meteorite will install/uninstall/upgrade packages as the specification changes.
  </p>

  <h3>Manually</h3>
  
  <p>
    As mentioned above <code>smart.json</code> can be maintained manually. For more info <a href="https://github.com/oortcloud/atmosphere/blob/master/app/smart.json">see Atmosphere's <code>smart.json</code></a> and <a href="http://oortcloud.github.com/meteorite">Meteorite's detailed documentation</a>.
  </p>
  

  <h2>Running the app</h2>

  <p>
    With the smart package installed and <code>smart.json</code> in place you can now run your app using Meteorite to start using the newly installed package.
  </p>

<pre>
mrt -p 3333
</pre>

  <h2>Guidelines</h2>

  <p>First off a couple soft rules, give us a shout if you have any questions on this...</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Publish packages that you use in your apps. We want packages that are well loved by their creators/curators. If you don't depend on it don't publish it.</li>
    <li>Don't use the word `meteor` in your package name. Your repo might be called `meteor-cool-pkg` but you should register it as `cool-pkg`. All packages are for Meteor so including it in the name is redundant.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Preparing <code>smart.json</code></h2>

  <p>
    Atmosphere's smart packages are <em>vanilla</em> smart packages that conform to Meteor's current (private) smart package API. If you can put it in Meteor's <code>packages/</code> dir and it works, it will also work with Meteorite and Atmosphere by default. If your package has no dependencies of its own and lives in a git repo, it's already installable with Meteorite.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two reasons you might want to add a <code>smart.json</code> to your smart package:
    <ol>
      <li>It has dependencies you want to tell Meteorite about so end users of your smart package won't have to worry about installing them</li>
      <li>You want to share your package via Atmosphere</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h3><code>smart.json</code> example</h3>
  
<pre>
{
  "name": "cool-pkg",
  "description": "Super cool package with dependencies",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/possibilities/meteor-cool-pkg",
  "author": "Mike Bannister <notimpossiblemike@gmail.com> (http://po.ssibiliti.es)",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "git": "https://github.com/possibilities/meteor-cool-pkg.git",
  "packages": {
    "another-cool-pkg": "0.1.1"
  }
}
</pre>

  <p>
    Note: don't include in the <code>packages</code> declaration meteor packages that aren't on Atmosphere, such as jquery. Only include Atmospere packages there. In other words, <code>smart.json</code> is for Atmosphere, <code>package.js</code> is for meteor, and it's in <code>package.js</code> where you can have an <code>api.use('jquery', 'client');</code> statement if necessary.
  </p>  


  <h2>Testing your package</h2>
  <p>
    Make sure to test your package works, before publishing it. To do that, create an app that uses your package, and in that app's root directory, have a <code>smart.json</code> that points to the local path of your package:
  </p>

<pre>
{
  "meteor": {
    "branch": "master"
  },
  "packages": {
    "my-new-package" : {
      "path": "/home/meteordev/meteor-my-new-package"
    }
  }
}  
</pre>

  <p>
    Make sure the app also includes your package in <code>.meteor/packages</code>. Now run the app with <code>mrt</code>. If everything goes well, you're ready to write the <code>README.md</code> file and publish.
  </p>
  

  <h2>Publishing</h2>

  <p>Once you have a <code>smart.json</code> in place and you've pushed the code to its origin (yes, everything is git-based right now), you can use Meteorite to publish the repository to Atmosphere (or any compatible server).</p>

  <p class="alert">
    At this point you'll need an account on Atmosphere to continue. If you don't have one click on "Sign in" in the upper right hand corner to get started!
  </p>

  <h3><code>mrt release &lt;path&gt;</code></h3>

  <p>
    Meteorite's <code>release</code> subcommand will verify the repo is committed, push, add a tag for the current version, push the tag and publish the package to Atmosphere.
  </p>

  <h3><code>mrt publish &lt;path&gt;</code></h3>

  <p>
    If you need more control over the release process you can use Meteorite's <code>publish</code> subcommand to publish the package to Atmosphere after you've tagged and pushed the repo.
  </p>

  <h2>Example packages</h2>
  
  <p>
    An excellent example of a package that does everything by the book, and includes CSS, images and JavaScript, is <a href="https://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/jquery-rateit">jquery-rateit</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Adding <a href='https://travis-ci.org' target='_blank'>Travis-CI</a> support</h2>

  <p>
    It is really important have tests in your packages. You can do it easily with <a href='http://www.eventedmind.com/posts/meteor-testing-packages-with-tinytest' target='_blank'>tinytest</a>. With travis-ci you can build these tests on the cloud and put a small notitfication image on your packages as shown below.
  </p>

  <p>
  <img src="https://travis-ci.org/arunoda/meteor-cluster.png?branch=master"><br>
  </p>

  <p>
    just add following file as <code>.travis.yml</code> to your project and you are done.
  </p>

<pre>
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "0.10"
before_install:
  - "curl -L http://git.io/ejPSng | /bin/sh"

    <p>
      Why is Gittip important?  Well, consider the dreaded <b>Dead Package Syndrome</b> :-).   Someone releases a cool and useful package as a fun creative effort.  But months later, it no longer works with the latest version of Meteor... pull requests go unanswered... issues pile up.  Creating a package is rewarding, but ongoing maintenance can be a lot of work (and often, not nearly as much fun :)

      Happen to have more money than time right now?  Fund the efforts important to you, and avoid having packages you rely on slowly die.  Or, happen to have more time than money at the moment?  Become a Gittip recipient and get support for the community work you put in.
