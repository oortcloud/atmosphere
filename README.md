# Old version of Atmospherejs.com

[Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com) is a database of smart packages for [Meteor](http://meteor.com), the Node.js framework.

This repo contains a very old version of the Atmosphere app. [The new Atmosphere isn't open sourced yet.](https://github.com/percolatestudio/atmosphere/issues/219) However, [that](https://github.com/percolatestudio/atmosphere/issues) is the place to file issues.
